# RealXaml
RealXaml is a live viewer and hot reloader for Xamarin Forms. 

## Do I need it?
No if you don't like stuff like Hot Reload and Live Reload :)

## How it helps me?
It speeds up the development of Xamarin.Forms applications letting you to edit .xaml files and see changes in real time. It also allow you to deploy the core assembly of your app to see instant changes without a full compile in all devices and simulator.

## Getting started
To start use RealXaml in your solution you have to:

First install the RealXaml Visual Studio 2017 extension. (2019 version will come very shortly)

Once the extension is installed, open or create a new Xamarin.Forms app solution. When the solution is fully loaded, you have to activate RealXaml.
To activate RealXaml just go to the Tools menu in Visual Studio and click on the "Enable RealXaml" menu item.

Then you need to install the AdMaiora.RealXaml.Client nuget package in your Xamarin.Forms app solution.
